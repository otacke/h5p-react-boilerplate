# H5P Boilerplate for React Content

This project is based on two examples:

H5P Bolierplate from Joubel https://github.com/h5p/h5p-boilerplate

and

H5P React simple demo by S. Retting https://github.com/sr258/h5p-sharedb-test

Hopefully this is helpful for using React content in H5P library.


Requirements:

- NodeJS >= 16
- NPM >= 7

Clone this repository with git and check out the branch that you are interested
in (or choose the branch first and then download the archive, but learning
how to use git really makes sense).

Change to the repository directory and run

```bash
npm install
```

to install required modules. Afterwards, you can build the project using

```bash
npm run build
```

or, if you want to let everything be built continuously while you are making
changes to the code, run

```bash
npm run build:watch
```

Before putting the code in production, you should always run `npm run build`.
